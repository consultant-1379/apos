# This file contains the rules for the physical-to-logical disk mapping for vAPG Storage.

# DO NOT WRAP THIS LINE
#
# old udev does not understand some of it,
# and would end up skipping only some lines, not the full rule.
# which can cause all sort of trouble with strange-named device nodes
# for completely unrelated devices,
# resulting in unusable network lookback, etc.
#
# in case this is "accidentally" installed on a system with old udev,
# having it as one single line avoids those problems.
#
# DO NOT WRAP THIS LINE

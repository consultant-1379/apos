##
# This file contains the models to be included in the current APOS release.
# The file syntax must comply with the following rules:
#	- all the paths are relative to the /vobs/IO_Developments/MODELS/APZIM/
#	  directory (leading / can be omitted).
#	- Only one model per line is allowed.
#	- Each line must be a <model_path>|<file_permissions> pair, with
#	  <model_path> being a file reachable by the current config-spec and
#	  <file_permissions> being an octal-mask of the permissions of the file
#	  when deployed on the target machine.
#	- Lines beginning with a # character will be ignored (comments).
